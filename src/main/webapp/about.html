      <h2 class="about-text-right">About Us</h2>
      <p class="about-text-right">SweatMate is a platform created by us, <span style="font-weight: bold">Arthur</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Felix</span>, two students from HTBLA Kaindorf. <br>
        As fitness enthusiasts and students, we embarked on this project with a shared passion for health and well-being.<br><br>

        With SweatMate, our aim was to develop a platform that allows users to upload and discover a variety of training plans.<br>
        We wanted to create a space where individuals could find workout routines tailored to their preferences and goals.<br><br>

        Through hard work and dedication, we brought SweatMate to life as a project at school.<br>
        It has been an exciting journey, from coding and designing to refining the platform's features.
